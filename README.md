[![Tester Task CI](https://github.com/Viacheslav-Romanov/tester-task/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Viacheslav-Romanov/tester-task/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Key points to check in test task:

- README file presence
- Logical project structure
- Minimal hardcoding, proper constants usage
- Code scalability and maintainability
- Test atomicity and independence
- Code reusability

The primary focus is on the quality of automated tests and project structure. The load test is an additional task, and its absence will not be considered as a disadvantage in the assessment.
